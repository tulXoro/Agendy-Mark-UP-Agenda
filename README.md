# CONCEPT
An app which plans out what the user will do for the week and following days. Unlike a typical notepad, the user will be able to quickly select important events, assignments, etc. Alternatively, the user can type on their own, but this isn't reccommended. The app may suggest when the user should study, tutor, etc. and notify them when to start and stop.
