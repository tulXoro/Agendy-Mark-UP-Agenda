# CONCEPT
An app which plans out what the user will do for the week and following days. Unlike a typical notepad, the user will be able to quickly select important events, assignments, etc. Alternatively, the user can type on their own, but this isn't recommended. The app may suggest when the user should study, tutor, etc. and notify them when to start and stop.

*Weekly planner that allows easy access and organization. Helps time manage. Convenience. Can include time slots, notifications, multiple inputs per day.*


# Dev Diary 
## May 14, 2019
	Our plan is to create a minimalistic program which focuses on convenience and organization. It is a notepad with an easy-to-understand interface, and catered towards students. Of course, we hope to incorporate ways to encourage teachers and staff to use it, but we arenâ€™t sure whether we will be able to implement those sort of things with the given time limit.
